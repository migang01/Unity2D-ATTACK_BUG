# Unity2D-ATTACK_BUG
&lt;Top-down shooting - WebGL>

Second game as topdown shooting game. WebGL build.

Move with arrow keys(or wasd) and attack with left mouse button. From 4 entrances on right and left, up and bottom, enemies are spawned randomly. Red&mint colour bugs are weakest one, then yellow bug, and strongest one is blue one. Blue one makes trap(easy to think it as bug poo..) at regular intervals that hurts player but it can be removed with one attack. If player loses all health then game over.
